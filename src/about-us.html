                                We humans are always perceived differently — different in the way we think, act, and make our choices. Every one of us is different in a distinct way — in the music we listen to, in the sports we play, in the way we work, in the way we travel, and even in the way we pass our time doing nothing. This is what makes us the UNIQUE beings that we are.
