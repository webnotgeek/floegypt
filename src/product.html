                        <h2>UNIQUE BY NATURE</h2>
                        <p>
                            For the first time in Egypt and the Middle East, alkaline water is being introduced to the market, bringing the latest drinking trends in health-conscious countries like Japan and America to the region.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A healthy human body should be at a pH level of 7, yet most human bodies are not properly balanced and contain far too much acid because of poor diets and a lack of physical activity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Indeed, with a pH level ranging from 7.6 to 8, FLO is a highly nourishing water mix that basically carries a more refreshing value for its drinkers. Moreover, this most hydrating of products carries 80 percent less sodium than average water, presenting a rare ideality in both health and taste.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since 70 percent of the body is composed of water, FLO Water is granting people the improved water source that they need to get the most out of their day. Filtered with the newest Japanese technologies for purification, FLO balances the acidic level in the human body and infuses it with minerals such as silica (silicon dioxide), calcium, potassium, and magnesium, helping consumers be in the best shape of their lives in the process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            FLO does not just grant consumers a perfected source of water, but also extends such quality to producing plastic bottles that are double the thickness of regular brands, all presented in a label decorated with sleek and innovative branding that celebrates unique life.
